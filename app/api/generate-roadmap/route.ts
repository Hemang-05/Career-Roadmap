      move_abroad
        ? "plans to move abroad to " + preferred_abroad_country
        : "does not plan to move abroad"
    }. The student has "${previous_experience}" in the field.

The roadmap should:
- Cover the years from "${current_class}" until the end of secondary education (typically 12th grade or equivalent in "${residing_country}"), divided into four 3-month phases per year.
- Include milestones relevant to "${desired_career}", taking into account the educational system and career pathways of "${residing_country}".
- Provide each milestone with DIFFICULTY_SPECIFIC_TASK_COUNT actionable tasks that include weights (indicating importance) and a completion status (initially set to false). Provide explanation or description of that task in atleast 2 to 3 lines.

Tailor the tasks to the student's specific situation:
- Residing Country: Incorporate relevant exams, qualifications, or educational requirements specific to "${residing_country}".
- Spending Capacity: Adjust task recommendations based on "${spending_capacity}" (e.g., suggest free online resources if low, or paid courses/bootcamps if high).
- Move Abroad: If the student plans to move to "${preferred_abroad_country}", include tasks such as language learning, cultural adaptation, visa preparation, or understanding the education system of that country.
- Previous Experience: Use "${previous_experience}" to adjust the starting pointâ€”skip beginner tasks or include more advanced ones if the student has prior knowledge.

Also, structure the roadmap year-wise. For example:
- If the student is in India and currently in 9th grade, generate a roadmap until 12th grade (4 years). For students in other countries, generate the roadmap until the end of school (before college).
- Within each year, divide the roadmap into four 3-month phases.
- The roadmap should be sequential, with later years building upon the achievements of previous years.
- Give detailed explanation about the task in atleast 2 to 3 lines.
- Use the current day and month ("${current_day} ${current_month}") as the starting point for planning the phases.
- Include the required Youtube tutorials/video if suggesting to start a course and learning or websites which might be helpful in "${desired_career}".
The response must be strictly in JSON format without any additional text, markdown formatting, or backticks, and must exactly match the following structure:
